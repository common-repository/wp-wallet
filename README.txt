== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the WP Wallet plugin? =

1. Create an account on [WP Wallet](https://wpwallet.com/)
2. Download, install, and activate the plugin
3. Navigate to the WP Wallet link on your WP admin sidebar
4. Connect your site to WP Wallet using your email address and unique auth code
5. Click Send to WP Wallet

= Do I need to use the WP Wallet plugin to use WP Wallet? =

No, you can use the site scanner on WP Wallet once you add a site to your account.

However, some of our users have found the plugin to be more effective at identifying all of the themes and plugins installed on their site — especially if they have higher security settings, WordPress installed in a subfolder, or plugins that don’t include a readme.txt file.

= How do I add a theme or plugin that didn’t show up in the scan? =

The site scanner and WP Wallet check for hundreds of the most popular plugins across the WordPress ecosystem, but you may want to keep track of a plugin or theme that didn’t show up in the scan originally.

1. Navigate down to the Licenses section of your site and click the green “Add Plugin/Theme” button
2. Fill out any of the relevant form fields and select Save

Reminder: WP Wallet is used to track the plugins/themes active on your site, but adding or removing a plugin and theme to WP Wallet is not the same as adding or removing it to your live WordPress site.
